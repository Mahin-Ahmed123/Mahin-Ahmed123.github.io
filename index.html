      <h3>Mahin Ahmed</h3>
      <p> I am new to coding and have had no prior knowledge of coding. This Bootcamp has been extraordinary
      and hellped me alot. I still have a ton to learn and improve on but still greatfull that city included
  this bootcamp in this computer science course. I still do not know where I will be heading in the future but
I am prepared to take any opportunity thats comes my way.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: The Solar System</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of randomness,sounds and 3D shapes/objects. I created a 3D render of
	the solar system where there is details on each planet which varys from the size
	and the colour aswell as rotation speeds. The planets posisions are distanced by 
	varying numbers and pixels on the screen to portray the impression of a real 
	solar system model. The stars in space were all randomly generated and placed in
	a random pixel. these were done by usuing the random method/function to place "points" 
	in location inside the 3D box.

    <h3>Java Game 2021: Jewels In Time</h3>
    <p>
	My second programming project, concluding the 3 milestone java project at 
	City (2020/2021). This Java project was made possible with the help of the city 
	physics engine. This gave access to the use of gravity, velocity and a virtual insite
	on reality. My game, Jewels in Time, consist of many levels which the player runs through.
	In order to pass the levels, the player must not lose 3 of their lives, they need to collect all
	the gold in each level and in order to enter the portal, they will need to collect the 
	key. Each level has a different background image and soundtrack and when a collision is detected,
	a sound is played corresponding to the object the user collided with. Finally, the GUI buttons
	at the bottom of the screen allows the user to quit, pause, resume or even preview the next
	level.
